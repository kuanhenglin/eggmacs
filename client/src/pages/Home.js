      <h2> Hail and well met! </h2>
      <p2 maxlength ="50">Tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) have been bringing communities together for decades.
        Dungeons and Dragons, Monster of the Week, Pathfinder, and dozens of other TTRPGs provide an 
        opportunity to eat junk food with your friends every weekend and tell a cool story together. 
        Our team aims to make things easier for new Game Masters to create their own campaigns. 
        Logistics such as map creation and stat rolling are an imperative part of the world-building process, 
        we believe our virtual web application can help to make the process more efficient and accessible.
